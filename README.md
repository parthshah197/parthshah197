# Hello, I'm Parth Shah üëã

I'm a passionate Data Scientist and Analytics Engineer, currently pursuing an MS in Business Analytics & Artificial Intelligence (Data Science & Engineering track) at The University of Texas at Dallas. My mission is to leverage data to address complex challenges and drive business growth.

**4.5 years of experience in Product Analytics & Experimentation @ Media.net (Ad-Tech)**:
- Led improvements for Ad-Exchange and Programmatic Products (Header Bidding, Prebid, Open Bidding) at Media.net
- Designed and executed A/B tests to optimize product performance
- Developed statistical models to maximize key metrics including profit margin, revenue rate and win rate
- Created new data pipelines to enhance data flow and analysis capabilities
- Built dashboards to monitor critical KPIs (win rates, revenue, CPM, latency/timeouts, cookie match rate, viewability, traffic quality), while conducting in-depth funnel analyses of the entire bidding process.

I love solving problems, so if you need help with a business/tech issue, please feel free to reach out to me directly at parthshah197@gmail.com!
